### Data Structures

## Stack
It’s like a stack of paper.
It offers “push” and “pop” methods.
In programming, function calls form a stack.
It’s a “LIFO” collection (i.e. “last in, first out”).

## Queue
It’s like a queue at a restaurant.
It offers “enqueue” and “dequeue” methods.
In computers, CPU operations form a queue.
It’s a “FIFO” collection (i.e. “first in, first out”).

## Linked list
It’s a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node by means of a pointer.
In double linked lists, each node also has a pointer to the previous one.
Insertion and deletion of nodes is not expensive.
There is no need to define an initial size.
It’s a dynamic data structure.

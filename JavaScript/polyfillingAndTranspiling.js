// Polyfilling and transpiling

// You can fully control your code environment in a server, but not in a browser.
// Remember to check what language features are supported where your code needs to be executed.
// Polyfilling means adding the code required for the new feature to run properly.
// Transpiling is a way to translate code that uses new features into the equivalent code if it was using older features.
